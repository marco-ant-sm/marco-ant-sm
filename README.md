<td text-align="left" width="70%">
Iâ€™m a recently graduated Computer Engineer with hands-on experience in software
development, problem-solving, and teamwork. I've worked with programming languages
like Python and JavaScript, web development frameworks such as React, Django, Laravel and
managed databases with MySQL. Iâ€™m eager to apply my skills in a backend or full-stack
development role, as well as explore opportunities in testing or DevOps.
